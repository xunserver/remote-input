# Step 2: Review

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- All review subagents must run at the same model capability as the current session.
- Run subagents synchronously: launch them together, then wait for all results before continuing.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. The review layers are `{workflow.review_layers}`, resolved during activation.

2. For each layer in `{workflow.review_layers}`:
   - `instruction` empty or missing → drop the layer silently (an override disabled it).
   - `when` condition present and not satisfied by the current context (`{review_mode}`, `{spec_file}`) → drop the layer and tell the user, e.g. "Acceptance Auditor skipped — no spec file provided."
   - otherwise → the layer is active.

   If no layer is active, HALT with status `blocked` and blocking condition `no active review layers`.

3. Execute all active layers in parallel wherever their execution methods allow: substitute the runtime placeholders (`{diff_output}`, `{spec_file}`) into each layer's `instruction`, then follow it verbatim. If a layer's instruction requires subagents and subagents are not available, generate prompt files in `{implementation_artifacts}` for each such layer and HALT. Ask the user to run each in a separate session (ideally a different LLM) and paste back the findings. When findings are pasted, treat them as those layers' findings and resume from this point.

4. **Layer failure handling**: If any layer fails, times out, or returns empty results, append the layer's `name` to `{failed_layers}` (comma-separated) and proceed with findings from the remaining layers.

5. Collect all findings from the completed layers, keeping track of each finding's originating layer `id`.
